This readme file serves as a basic guidance on the usage of evolutionary simulations.

## Instructions

  #### System Requirements

  ###### JDK
    1.7 or above (this is to execute Maven - it still allows you to build against 1.3
    and prior JDK's).
    
  ###### Memory:
    No minimum requirement.
    
  ###### Disk:
    Approximately 10MB is required for the Maven installation itself. In addition to
    that, additional disk space will be used for your local Maven repository. The size
    of your local repository will vary depending on usage but expect at least 500MB.
  
  ###### Operating System:
    Windows:
      Windows 2000 or above.
    Unix based systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X) and others:
      No minimum requirement.
      
  #### Installation
    1. Deploy the Maven project
    2. Install networkx, numpy, pandas and community API for pythons. 
    3. Run evolutionary simulations in the evolution folder. 
    P.S. Intellij is highly recommended.
