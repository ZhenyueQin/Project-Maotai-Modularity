\section{Background}
Figure \ref{fig:network-example} demonstrates examples of non-modular and modular networks.

In the inception phase of this project, we utilized the Louvain heuristics to compute the partition of the network vertices in order to maximize the modularity of the given graph \cite{blondel2008fast}. We applied the tournament selection scheme with the tournament size being three and the elitism mechanism with ten elites in every generation. As a result of this setting, the partition of the gene regulatory networks by the Louvain heuristics demonstrated a very low modularity score. As Figure \ref{fig:early-modularity-not-work} indicates where the green line represents the generation to introduce specialization, by simulating the work in \cite{espinosa2010specialization}, we had expected there would be a spike after gene specialization on modularity. Nevertheless, we observed a modularity decrease as a result after gene specialization.

	\label{fig:modularity-worked-without-elitism}
\end{figure}
In order to understand this puzzling phenomenon, we removed the elitism mechanism and changed the tournament to proportional selection scheme. In consequence, we eliminated the deviant phenomenon as Figure \ref{fig:modularity-worked-without-elitism} indicates. Therefore, we hypothesized that the elitism mechanism or the tournament selection scheme hamper the evolutionary process on evolving out modular structures.
