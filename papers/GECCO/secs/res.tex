\section{Results}
This is where we present the detailed results. We need fitness and modularity 
results. We also need the comparison between the optimum and the fittests
high-modularity solutions. Then we need the results of deleting non-modular 
links from optimal solutions, and comparing resulting fitnesses, and showing the
fitnesses of intervening paths. Finally, it may be desirable to check the result
of evaluating the fitness of a good solution under one sampling method from one
generation with the fitness of that solution under some other fitness function
(i.e. how much do the fitnesses of an individual vary from generation to 
generation under Espinosa-Soto evaluation? How different are the Larson 
fitnesses? Are the differences larger or smaller for modular or non-modular
solutions?
