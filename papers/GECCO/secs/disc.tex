\section{Discussion}
This is where we discuss the results, and their implications. Basically, we
express this as puzzlement: we need to understand the fitness landscape better,
and this probably requires better tools. We also discuss the sensitivity of the
fitness landscape and the emergence of modularity, and compare it with 
biological evolution, where the emergence of modularity is robust and almost
universal.
