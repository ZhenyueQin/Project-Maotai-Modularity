\section{Methods}
This is where we describe what we're going to do. As discussed previously, 
we don't mention symmetry or noisy evaluation in this paper, nor do we cover 
hotspots, diploidy or dominance.

What we do work with is a basic GA with mutation as per previous work, and cross
over. The variations are:

Espinosa Soto vs Larson fitness function
Fitness proportionate (roulette) selection vs tournament (maybe a couple of different tournament sizes)

We may end up merging this with the experiments section
