Here is the main body of the paper. 

You probably only need to make modifications in the secs directory (the 
individual sections of the paper) and the bib directory (where your personal 
bibliography goes). 

In particular, please leave the acmart.cls file here (so that it overrides any
other acmart.cls - in particular, if one comes with your linux/windows latex
distribution, it is almost certainly too out-of-date).

Ideally, please use the texlive distribution. Other versions of latex may work,
but only texlive is fully cross-platform, and there may be incompatibilities 
between other versions.
